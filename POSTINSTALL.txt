POST INSTALL!

- This installer comes with a couple of post-install scripts:
lutil.sh: (highly recommend)
Download various packages for development, media, office and fun in a tui interface

get-my-dots.sh: (If you don't know what Hyprland is/don't want to run Hyprland, don't use this)
My hyprland, zsh, neovim dotfile setup script, very simple  

- Or, you don't have to use lutil to download packages.
- Downloading a package is easy - just run sudo pacman -S package-name
- If you haven't already, download a desktop enviroment like gnome or plasma
sudo pacman -S gnome
- Then, if you still don't have a GUI:
sudo systemctl enable --now gdm (gnome for example)
sudo systemctl enable --now sddm (plasma for example)
